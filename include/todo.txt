allow iterators/ranges
less pointer passing internally
strong type on keys 
try doing a version where the segments cover the uniform range and skew to non uniform locations
avoid running the full set of keys multiple times when building
memory usage plotting 
key value
mixed distributions
remove benchmarks ci
better explanation for error bounds
not sure "Your dataset is small (<1000 elements) - index overhead isn't worth it" makes sense anymore
"The template parameters are:" add bounds checking
can i get an Md or html to show all index plots
use specified models?
optimise hot path
multi threaded build?
we don't seem to ever do the binary search on the segments
